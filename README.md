# Still Struggling With...
I can't figure out why my UV index won't show up when the URL is correct in console.log. I also had a lot of issues with my local storage. I am trying really hard to understand and figure it out, but it hasn't clicked yet. I thought it would fix when I figured out how to change the city with my search, but it still shows as undefined, which ruined my data from the past array that was supposed to persist. I know this is incomplete, but my goal is to revamp and ask to be regraded later if needed when I have a better handle on how to fix my issues. 

## 1/6/21 Update
This project drove me crazy for months, but finally has functionality. There are some more things that I could do to clean up the UI, but for now this will do. The city typed in the search passes into all my functions, local storage works, buttons work, and past searches store as needed. At this point, I am just thankful it is functional.
